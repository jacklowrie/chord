# chord
implementation of chord

right now, we're thinking we implement chord (in python) and set it up so we 
can run it on mininet, then we run the simulations they describe in the paper 
on that network, and we implement one of the applications they run on top - in
the paper, they describe large-scale distributed combinatorialsearch, so we 
could write a password cracking program that runs distributed on the chord 
network.
